# DIY ESP32 Engine monitoring for all internal combustion engines 
Engine Doc for all chainsaws, small engines and automotive.  

## Use Case:
The original ideea is to use this for performance chainsaw tuning by monitoring the EGT (exhaust gas temp) or cylinder/head temp we have valuable information 
we can use to track/correlate our changes and even monitor saws with autotune or needs. 

## Description:

An ESP32 microcontroller with a high temp thermocouple interface you can mount in or stick to any surface you want to measure. 

Also has a separate BME280 temp/baro and humidity sensor that will be in the box enclosure or you could remote mount it in an airbox or whatever. 

I may make a one-wire inductive tachometer pickup too which will be interrupt driven and may need amp circuit

The ESP32 makes its own Wifi AP you can log in to with your phone- open any browser to the IP in the pic and it will graph the data real time asynchronously on the web page as long as its powered on.

TBD 

Used Adafruit example code- seems to work fine if you change the default pins
